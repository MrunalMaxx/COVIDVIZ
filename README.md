# COVIDVIZ
Created a monthly visualizations of co-vid cases in 2020

When I first see the data of Shortly Analytics! In Co-Vid cases data there is confirmed, death and recovery cases data of each day and each country. I feel like anyone who sees that data cannot visualize the situation. So I Created visualizations of monthly confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries of 2020 through out the world. Where users can easily hover and find the data and also comparison at the same time.


you can find the visualizations here.
